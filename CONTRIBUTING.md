## Authorship: 
This project is intended to lead to journal publications, in addition to other potential applications. To be an author on a publication, contributors must meet accepted standards for authorship in the sciences. All prospective authors must participate substantively to all of the following: 

* Generating ideas; planning and implementing models or experiments; and/or analysis of data/results.
* Writing, substantive editing, and revision of the paper (both pre-submission and after review).  
* Choosing the venue for publication and approving submission. All authors must approve submission.

Contributors who make substantive contributions that do not qualify for authorship may be acknowledged by name in the paper. All contributors will be acknowledged in a contributors list on the repo.

Multiple papers are likely to result from this project. At the point that one or more contributors envision a specific paper, they should decide whether they want to fork the repo and work in a smaller group to provide more stability, or continue working within this repo, where other people may continue to suggest contributions. People who plan to write a paper must invite anyone to be an author who who has contributed substantively to the conception, implementation, analysis, or writing/editing of the material in the paper. Regardless of who is named as an author, give credit where credit is due.
