**COMMENTS WELCOME: Please send to open an 'issue' to suggest improvements**

# Contributions welcome!

## Who can contribute:

We welcome contributions by everyone, regardless of experience level or field of expertise. In addition to answering our research questions, we hope to encourage science enthusiasts and amateur scientists to participate in developing new ideas and approaches. Therefore, we welcome participation by people of all experience levels. In addition, this project will involve a combination of experimental, computational, and theoretical work; so, we encourage people with different types of skills to participate.

## Types of contributions:

Possible contributions might include, but are not limited to:

* Improving the code that runs the model
* Adding features to the model
* Creating/editing explanatory text and figures
* Creating CAD models of the study system for 3D printing
* Designing and implementing experiments
* Questions, suggestions, and critiques are very helpful

If unsure, feel free to contact me at mickey {dot} vondassow {at sign} ronininstitute {dot} org.

## How to contribute:

To identify problems or suggest fixes, features, new hypotheses, etc: raise an issue.
To add or modify material: create a branch, make the desired modification or add file, and create a pull request.

We want to maintain accessibility to a wide range of experience levels, therefore:
 * Comment code obsessively, and explain reasoning carefully.
 * Use meaningful variable names (and define them for humans in comments) 
 * Avoid jargon, or at least explain it clearly.

## Authorship: 
This project is intended to lead to journal publications, in addition to other potential applications. To be an author on a publication, contributors must meet accepted standards for authorship in the sciences. All prospective authors must participate substantively to all of the following: 

* Generating ideas; planning and implementing models or experiments; and/or analysis of data/results.
* Writing, substantive editing, and revision of the paper (both pre-submission and after review).  
* Choosing the venue for publication and approving submission. All authors must approve submission.

Contributors who make substantive contributions that do not qualify for authorship may be acknowledged by name in the paper. All contributors will be acknowledged in a contributors list on the repo.

Multiple papers are likely to result from this project. At the point that one or more contributors envision a specific paper, they should decide whether they want to fork the repo and work in a smaller group to provide more stability, or continue working within this repo, where other people may continue to suggest contributions. People who plan to write a paper must invite anyone to be an author who who has contributed substantively to the conception, implementation, analysis, or writing/editing of the material in the paper. Regardless of who is named as an author, give credit where credit is due.

## Conduct

* Be respectful of others
* Give credit where credit is due (and cite sources carefully)
* Maintain high standards of scientific integrity

Please report instances of abuse, harassment, fraud, plagiarism, or other unacceptable behavior to mickey {dot} vondassow {at sign} ronininstitute {dot} org. Depending on severity and frequency, violators may be warned or removed from the project.
